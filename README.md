💡 Ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence can assist doctors in analyzing blood tests?
In this video, I’ll show you how I built a YOLO-powered AI Blood Cell Detection System that automatically detects and counts RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets from blood smear images — and even generates a professional lab-style PDF report 🩸🤖

This project demonstrates how Computer Vision + Deep Learning (YOLO) can be used in real-world healthcare applications to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy.

🚀 What you’ll see in this video (Step-by-Step):

✅ Upload blood smear images using a modern web interface
✅ Detect RBC, WBC & Platelets using a trained YOLO object detection model
✅ Draw bounding boxes with confidence scores on the image
✅ Display real-time cell counts on a dashboard
✅ Generate charts & statistics automatically
✅ Create a professional PDF lab report with:

Processed image
Cell count summary
Distribution graphs
Timestamp & AI disclaimer

🧠 By the end of this video, you’ll learn how to:

🔹 Train and deploy a YOLO model for medical image analysis
🔹 Integrate AI with a Flask web application
🔹 Build a modern healthcare dashboard UI
🔹 Generate automated medical reports using Python
🔹 Combine Deep Learning, Web Development & Data Visualization into one complete system

🛠 Technologies Used:

Python, YOLO, Flask, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, ReportLab, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

💬 If you’re a beginner or intermediate AI/ML learner, this project will help you understand how to convert a research-level idea into a real-world healthcare application.
